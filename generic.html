									<h1>About Me</h1>
									<p>Hello, I'm Sush. That's short for Sushrutha,<br />
										Yes! I know my name can be a bit of a tongue twister.<br />

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>A “Product Engineer and Data geek at Core” with 4 years' experience in technology management in Customer Experience Transformation, particularly in a Lean-Agile setting. I enjoy acting as a customer advocate, translating their needs into product goals and features, and ensuring that those features are built in a cohesive, well-designed manner that meets the customer's needs.</p>
								<p>After my bachelors in computer science, back in India, I worked for about 3 years in Accenture on a B2B web application in the capacity of multiple roles for AT&T. While working at Accenture, I experienced that not having a highly technical background has its shortcomings during collaboration with developers. It was also challenging for me to identify AI-specific opportunities to improve business workflow or augment its functionality with AI/ML components into existing systems. Hence, I decided to bridge that gap and joined a PGPDM program in collaboration with the University of Chicago specializing in Data Science. When that knowledge felt insufficient and I wanted to learn more, it led me here to the United States. I'm currently pursuing master’s degree in Data Science at UMBC, in Maryland and would be graduating in May. I'm also interning with an Ad-tech company, as product development Intern, where I work with team and senior Product Manager to brainstorm and develop MVPs/prototypes for the company. This is me just a glimpse of me  inside the cubicle.</p>
								<p>Outside my work place, I play guitar, bit of drums and I host meditation classes on weekends for 3 students. I keep myself physically active and travel often like an ENFP. </p>
