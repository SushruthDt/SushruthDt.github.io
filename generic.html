            A “Product Engineer and Data geek at Core” with 4 years' experience
            in technology management in Customer Experience Transformation,
            particularly in a Lean-Agile setting. I enjoy acting as a customer
            advocate, translating their needs into product goals and features,
            and ensuring that those features are built in a cohesive,
            well-designed manner that meets the customer's needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            After my bachelors in computer science, back in India, I worked for
            about 3 years in Accenture on a B2B web application in the capacity
            of multiple roles for AT&T. While working at Accenture, I
            experienced that not having a highly technical background has its
            shortcomings during collaboration with developers. It was also
            challenging for me to identify AI-specific opportunities to improve
            business workflow or augment its functionality with AI/ML components
            into existing systems. Hence, I decided to bridge that gap and
            joined a PGPDM program in collaboration with the University of
            Chicago specializing in Data Science. When that knowledge felt
            insufficient and I wanted to learn more, it led me here to the
            United States. I'm currently pursuing master's degree in Data
            Science at UMBC, in Maryland and would be graduating in May. I'm
            also interning with an Ad-tech company, as product development
            Intern, where I work with team and senior Product Manager to
            brainstorm and develop MVPs/prototypes for the company. This is me
            just a glimpse of me inside the cubicle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside my work place, I play guitar, bit of drums and I host
            meditation classes on weekends for 3 students. I keep myself
            physically active and travel often like an ENFP.
